## Explanation

- **components**: This folder contains all your components. Each component has its own folder, which contains the component implementation (`ComponentX.tsx`) and a `styles.ts` file where you can define the styled components specific to that component.

- **pages**: This folder contains all your Next.js pages. You can create different page files here, such as `index.tsx` for the home page and `about.tsx` for the about page. You can create additional folders to organize your pages if needed.

- **styles**: This folder holds global styles and theme-related files. `GlobalStyles.ts` can contain global CSS styles that are applied across the entire project. `theme.ts` can contain theme configurations like colors, fonts, etc.

- **public**: This folder is used to store static assets such as images, icons, etc. You can place your `favicon.ico` file and other assets here.

- **prisma**: This folder contains the Prisma database configuration. You can keep your `schema.prisma` file here, which defines the structure of your database and tables.

- **README.md**: This file is your project documentation. You can include information about the project structure, technologies used, and any other relevant details.

By structuring your project in this way, you can keep your components organized in the `components` folder, use the latest version of Next.js, and utilize Prisma for your database needs. Styled components can be defined within each component's `styles.ts` file, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.

Feel free to customize this structure further based on your specific project requirements.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
